// using loops create mini programs that do the following (you can put them all in one project)

//1
//prints out all of the values from 1-100

//2
//prints out all even numbers between 1-100

//3 
//prints out all of the odd numbers between 1-100

//4
//prints out all of the values between 5 and 80

//5
//prints out all of the values counting down between 50 and 5

//6 
//asks the user for 2 numbers and prints out all of the values
//between the two numbers

//7
// prints out the numbers 1-10, then prints out "I counted to 10, 1 times"
// then does it again until it gets to "I counted to 10, 10 times"

//8
// asks the user for 2  numbers and print out all of the numbers between the numbers that are divisible by 3.  
// use the % operator to find out if a number is divisible by 3.
// the % operator will return the remainder so: 10%3 returns the remainder of 
// 10/3 - > 10/3 is 3 and 1/3 so 10%3 returns 1.
// this means 
/* if(x%3 == 0){
	print("number is divisible by 3");
}*/
