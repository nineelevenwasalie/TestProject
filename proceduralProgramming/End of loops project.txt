Write a program that asks for a number and calculates all prime numbers less than the given number.  Remember a prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. Hint: you can either use the % operatorin order to determine if it was evenly divisible.

Examples:

double num1;
double num2;
if (num1%num2==0){
	print("num1 is evenly divisible by num2");
}
